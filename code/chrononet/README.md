# Chrononet: RNN based classifier 
The code in this folder contains an implementation of the Chrononet architecture proposed by Subhrajit et. Al in [1]. 
The experiment test generalizability of deep learning model on NMT dataset.
## Run
1. Modify data directory in config.py
2. chrono.py auguments data and train model 
3. evalchrono.py loads stored model for evaluation 
##

## Acknowledgement
chrononet experiments are based on implementation by Kunal Patel et al available at link below:
