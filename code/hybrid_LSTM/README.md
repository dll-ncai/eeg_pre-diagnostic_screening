# Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model for EEG classification
A  hybrid  model  is  designed  to  solve  EEG  yield  problem using  features  learned  from  Deep  CNN discussed here
`The NME Scalp EEG Dataset: An Open-Source Annotated Dataset of Healthy and Pathological EEG Recordings for Predictive Modeling`
## Run
1. diagnose loads shallow/deep.pt model to extract features from EEG signals
2. hybrid_LSTM loads features from mat files to train LSTM model for classification
