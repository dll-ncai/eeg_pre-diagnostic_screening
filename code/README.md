This code is released with NMT and uses braindecode to test generalization of CNN on EEG anomaly detection as discussed in 
The NME Scalp EEG Dataset: An Open-Source Annotated Dataset of Healthy and Pathological EEG Recordings for Predictive Modeling
## Requirements
1. Depends on https://robintibor.github.io/braindecode/ 
2. This code was programmed in Python 3.6 (might work for other versions also).
